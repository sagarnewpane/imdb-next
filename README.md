# IMDb Clone â€“ Next.js Learning Project

This is a simple IMDb clone built to understand the basic concepts and workflow of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. The project was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and focuses on client-side routing, static site generation, dynamic rendering, and API integration.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore how Next.js works in practice, including:
- File-based routing
- API requests and rendering movie data
- Dynamic routes and components
- Deployment-ready performance optimization

## Features

- Browse popular and top-rated movies
- View detailed movie information with dynamic routing
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS (if used)
- Basic image optimization using Next.js built-in features
